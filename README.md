# AdvancedSpawners
AdvancedSpawners is a Minecraft Paper-based plugin that adds additional features to the vanilla Minecraft spawner, like a leveling system and configuring spawners on the fly with an in-game menu. Highly customizable: determine a spawner's maximum level, configure each individual level, change the spawned mob type and more!

## Features
* Access a spawner's menu by right-clicking it with an empty hand.
* Upgrade spawners, increasing their spawn rate and spawn count.
* Add custom effects to spawners based on their current level.
* Show the spawn interval above a spawner. _(requires HolographicDisplays)_
* Configure the levels for spawners individually.
* Lock spawners, only allowing the spawner's owner (the player who placed it) to remove it or edit its settings.
* In-game commands for managing the plugin, as well as giving custom spawners to players.

## Support
For any questions, suggestions, errors and/or bugs you might have, go to the plugin's Bukkit page at https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/advanced-spawners/issues and create a ticket.
